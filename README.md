Hi there! Welcome to my developer journey. Whether you're a beginner like me or a seasoned professional, I hope my path inspires and resonates with you.

I'm an aspiring developer passionate about building things with code. My journey started with mastering HTML5 and CSS. I've dabbled in SASS/SCSS, but I haven't had the chance to explore Tailwind CSS yet‚Äîit's on my list for the future!

Beyond coding, I‚Äôm captivated by the world of art, 3D design, and animations. The way creativity brings imagination to life‚Äîwhether through a stunning visual, a fluid animation, or immersive 3D models‚Äîtruly amazes me. These fields remind me of the endless possibilities of blending technology with art, and I hope to explore them more deeply in the future.
